### add brushable blocks

you can add more simple brushable blocks by adding datapacks.
In which you need to add a `brushables` folder.
The path should look something like this: `datapacks/<datapack-name>/data/<namespace>/brushables/`.
In this folder you can add new `.json` files the name of the file can be anything.

for examples of the syntax have a look [here](src/main/resources/data/useful_brush/brushables)
